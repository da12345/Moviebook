# User stories

The user stories should cover the functionality of our application, through a description of an example use case.

## User story 1

When i've watched a new movie, i would like to be able to document what i think about the movie, and how it adds up against other movies i've watched.

To do this the user needs to be able to save all this information in a database, which he/she can load up and see at any time. The user needs to be able to see information about a movie such as the Title, the genres, and their own review whether that'd be a small comment or a number rating. It is nice for the user to be able to add and delete movies as they would like. 

To cover all of these needs, a nice user interface to see all this information would be handy. The user interface would also be set up to save information to file, and load information from file.
